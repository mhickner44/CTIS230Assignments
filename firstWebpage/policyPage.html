                <p>The following standards have been developed by the College to assure the protection of minors
                    participating in
                    programs and activities that are occurring on campus and/or under the control or direction of the
                    College,
                    regardless of location.</p>
                <h3><strong><u>College-Sponsored Programs and Activities</strong></u></h3>
                <p><strong>Program Approval:</strong> Every College-sponsored program must be reviewed and approved by
                    the
                    appropriate President’s
                    Cabinet member as soon as possible prior to the first scheduled date of participation by minors.
                </p>

                <p id="firstTest"> <strong>Checks:</strong> To ensure that children and teens are supported by qualified
                    adults in a safe and
                    secure environment,
                    all programs must conduct a criminal
                    background check (including a Sex Offender Registry check) on all new employees and volunteers who
                    work with,
                    interact,
                    instruct or otherwise directly supervise minors. Current employees who assume new duties that cause
                    them to work
                    with, interact, instruct, or directly supervise minors (when they previously did not) are also
                    subject to
                    background checks.<br>
                    Background checks must be completed and evaluated prior to the volunteer or employee beginning work
                    with minors.
                    All background checks related to the programs shall be conducted by the Department of Human
                    Resources or a
                    contractor/third party acting under its direction. At a minimum, programs must conduct criminal
                    background
                    checks on returning volunteers at least every two years.</p>
                <img src="firstPageImages/policy.jpg" id="policyImg" alt="policy checkmark image">
                <p> <strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> Program staff are expected to serve as positive role models for
                    children and
                    teens and act in a
                    caring, honest, respectful and responsible manner that is consistent with the mission and values of
                    the College.
                    Program staff are required to comply with all applicable laws and College policy and are expected to
                    perform
                    their
                    duties with the highest degree of integrity, honesty, and good judgment.
                    Program leaders and others working with minors must monitor the minors' behavior to prevent
                    interruptions to
                    College
                    business or instruction.</p>

                <p><strong>Training:</strong> Program leaders must ensure that employees, students, vendors,
                    sub-contractors and
                    volunteers complete
                    required pre-requisites and applicable training. At a minimum, training should include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Basic warning signs of abuse or neglect of minors.</li>
                    <li> Guidelines for protecting minors from emotional and physical abuse and neglect.</li>
                    <li> Requirements and procedures for reporting incidents of suspected abuse or neglect or improper
                        conduct.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Guilford College requires Program leaders to complete an online course entitled, “Protect Children” that
                covers these required elements.</p>

                <p> <strong>Supervision:</strong> All minor volunteers who are working with minors must be supervised at
                    all times
                    by a Guilford
                    College
                    employee.</p>

                <h3><strong><u>Non-College-Sponsored Programs:</u></strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Programs that are not sponsored by the College must comply with College facility usage requirements
                    for children
                    and
                    teen programming and must, at minimum:
                <ul>
                    <li> Provide eviadence to the College of $1 million of general liability insurance coverage that
                        lists
                        “Guilford College”
                        as an additional insured party.</li>
                    <li>Certify that they have conducted criminal background checks including a sex offender registry
                        check
                        within the
                        previous 12 months on all volunteers and program or event staff and that these background checks
                        did not
                        reveal any
                        prior criminal convictions (other than minor traffic offenses). Questions should be referred to
                        the
                        director of
                        Human Resources.</li>
                    <li>Provide appropriate adult supervision for the children or teens under their care. All programs
                        involving
                        minors must
                        be supervised by at least two or more authorized adults or by their parent(s) or legal
                        guardian(s) at
                        all times.</li>
