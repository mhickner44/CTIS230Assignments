    <p>The following standards have been developed by the College to assure the protection of minors participating in
        programs and activities that are occurring on campus and/or under the control or direction of the College,
        regardless of location.</p>
    <p><strong><u>College-Sponsored Programs and Activities</strong></u></p>
    <p><strong>Program Approval:</strong> Every College-sponsored program must be reviewed and approved by the
        appropriate President’s
        Cabinet member as soon as possible prior to the first scheduled date of participation by minors. </p>

    <p> <strong>checks:</strong> To ensure that children and teens are supported by qualified adults in a safe and
        secure environment,
        all programs must conduct a criminal
        background check (including a Sex Offender Registry check) on all new employees and volunteers who work with,
        interact,
        instruct or otherwise directly supervise minors. Current employees who assume new duties that cause them to work
        with, interact, instruct, or directly supervise minors (when they previously did not) are also subject to
        background checks.<br>
        Background checks must be completed and evaluated prior to the volunteer or employee beginning work with minors.
        All background checks related to the programs shall be conducted by the Department of Human Resources or a
        contractor/third party acting under its direction. At a minimum, programs must conduct criminal background
        checks on returning volunteers at least every two years.</p>

    <p> <strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> Program staff are expected to serve as positive role models for children and
        teens and act in a
        caring, honest, respectful and responsible manner that is consistent with the mission and values of the College.
        Program staff are required to comply with all applicable laws and College policy and are expected to perform
        their
        duties with the highest degree of integrity, honesty, and good judgment.
        Program leaders and others working with minors must monitor the minors' behavior to prevent interruptions to
        College
        business or instruction.</p>

    <p><strong>Training:</strong> Program leaders must ensure that employees, students, vendors, sub-contractors and
        volunteers complete
        required pre-requisites and applicable training. At a minimum, training should include:
        <ul>
        <li>Basic warning signs of abuse or neglect of minors.</li>
       <li> Guidelines for protecting minors from emotional and physical abuse and neglect.</li>
       <li> Requirements and procedures for reporting incidents of suspected abuse or neglect or improper conduct.</li>
        </ul>
        Guilford College requires Program leaders to complete an online course entitled, “Protect Children” that covers
        these required elements.</p>

    <p> <strong>Supervision:</strong> All minor volunteers who are working with minors must be supervised at all times
        by a Guilford
        College
        employee.</p>

    <p><strong><u>Non-College-Sponsored Programs:</u></strong></p>
    <p>
        Programs that are not sponsored by the College must comply with College facility usage requirements for children
        and
        teen programming and must, at minimum:
        <ul>
            <li> Provide evidence to the College of $1 million of general liability insurance coverage that lists
                “Guilford College”
                as an additional insured party.</li>
            <li>Certify that they have conducted criminal background checks including a sex offender registry check
                within the
                previous 12 months on all volunteers and program or event staff and that these background checks did not
                reveal any
                prior criminal convictions (other than minor traffic offenses). Questions should be referred to the
                director of
                Human Resources.</li>
            <li>Provide appropriate adult supervision for the children or teens under their care. All programs involving
                minors must
                be supervised by at least two or more authorized adults or by their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) at
                all times.</li>
    </p>
    </ul>
