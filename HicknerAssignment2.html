       <h2 >Protection of Minors on Campus </h2> 
        Out for Campus Review
    </div>
    <h3>Policy Statement: </h3>
    Because minors are a particularly vulnerable population, Guilford College will protect the safety of individuals who
    are less than 18 years of age from abuse and neglect by a parent, guardian, caregiver, employees, and/or staff of
    programs sponsored by or affiliated with the College, through specifically-established processes, procedures and
    stringent requirements.

    <h3>Purpose/Reason for Policy: </h3>
    To balance the requirement that the College take extra precautions to safeguard and protect minor children from
    potential abuse while on the Guilford campus with the desire to create a welcoming and safe environment for all
    individuals visiting the campus, participating in College sponsored programs, or participating in third-party
    programs and activities on campus.

    <h3>Scope/Covered Persons: </h3>
    This policy applies to all College representatives (faculty, staff, independent contractors, volunteers and
    students) interacting with minors on campus and in College-sponsored or -affiliated events, programs, and activities
    off campus. It also applies to unaffiliated individuals who interact with minors on campus.
    All programs intended for minors [athletic camps, academic camps, other programs and activities] fall within the
    scope of this policy, whether they are limited to one-time activities, ongoing programs, or involve the housing of
    minors in residence halls.
