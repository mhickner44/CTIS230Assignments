        <h3>Policy Statement: </h3>
        Because minors are a particularly vulnerable population, Guilford College will protect the safety of individuals
        who
        are less than 18 years of age from abuse and neglect by a parent, guardian, caregiver, employees, and/or staff
        of
        programs sponsored by or affiliated with the College, through specifically-established processes, procedures and
        stringent requirements.

        <h3>Purpose/Reason for Policy: </h3>
        To balance the requirement that the College take extra precautions to safeguard and protect minor children from
        potential abuse while on the Guilford campus with the desire to create a welcoming and safe environment for all
        individuals visiting the campus, participating in College sponsored programs, or participating in third-party
        programs and activities on campus.

        <h3>Scope/Covered Persons: </h3>
        This policy applies to all College representatives (faculty, staff, independent contractors, volunteers and
        students) interacting with minors on campus and in College-sponsored or -affiliated events, programs, and
        activities
        off campus. It also applies to unaffiliated individuals who interact with minors on campus.
        All programs intended for minors [athletic camps, academic camps, other programs and activities] fall within the
        scope of this policy, whether they are limited to one-time activities, ongoing programs, or involve the housing
        of
        minors in residence halls.

        <h3>Definitions: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minor:</strong> Any person under the age of 18 who is not enrolled or accepted for enrollment at

            <li><strong> Sexual Abuse:</strong> Engaging in or attempting to engage in a sexual act or sexual contact

                attempting to cause a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, or exposing the minor to sexually
